# ECE324_project

Code for "Multi-Instrument Audio Source Separation". Our goal is to train a deep NN to separate audio sources from different instruments in a recording. 
We have two files:
- separator contains the definition of our model
- generate_music contains code to generate synthetic

We uploaded one example of our synthetic audio, in the "0" folder. It contains the individual tracks of piano, clarinet, and guitar along with the combined track.
